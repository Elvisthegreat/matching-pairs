MATCHING PAIRS or memory game is a delightful and challenging activity that tests your ability to recall information itâ€™s about training your brain to retain information and make connections. Its a very simple and easy game to play with time counting downward, you flip a card then flip another one to look for the same exact image, and when you match a pair...those two matched images stay without flipping back, then you have to continue till you match all rows and column. But if you are unable to match all cards before the time runs out, a end game function is called and you won't be able to flip anymore cards, the only way to keep on playing is to click on the restart button to get all functions back in place :D. So flip those cards, exercise your mind, and enjoy the thrill of matching!
